                        <span>CORROSION DANGER. WE PROTECT OUR PRODUCTS.</span>Forget about corrosion. We have
                        introduced a hot-dipped
                        galvanizing production line, which uses the worldâs
                        first-grade galvanizing process and a large-scale zinc pot
                        with zinc holding capacity of 1100 tons. We use 8 sets of
                        dedicated galvanizing high-speed pulse burners, an
                        automatic temperature control system (Japan FUJI),
                        systematic engineering and professional galvanizing furnace
                        design. All of them are customized for the steel tower
                        galvanizing process and characterized by rapid temperature
                        rise, ideal temperature uniformity and excellent heat
                        insulation effects. Thereâs also an original combustion
                        chamber function - a unique function to protect the zinc
                        pot and promote exhausted combustion during the burner
                        operation. The fully automatic temperature control system
                        and the automatic on/off feature of the burners ensure
                        constant temperature control for the zinc liquid
                        temperature and guarantee the galvanization quality. The
                        hot-dipped-galvanized production line effectively improves
                        the automation and production efficiency, reduces the
                        intensity of labor, improves the hot-dipped galvanizing
                        production environment and reduces environmental pollution,
                        by achieving the purpose of environmental protection,
                        energy conservation and production cost reduction and
                        improving the product quality.
